- Purpose
- - We have to design a game
- - will more-or-less conform to a formula
- - let's learn a bit about the formula to orient ourselves
- - we'll use the history of the genre to figure out why/how it's at where it's at
- History
- - Zork (http://textadventures.co.uk/games/play/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq)
- - - design-a-zork:
- - - - what can we do to make a _bad_ game (actually answer)
- - - - what can we do to make a _good_ game (rhetorical)
- - - we can move north, south, etc..
- - - interact with things
- - - (don't get distracted by difficulty of inputs- worth noting, but _gets solved_)
- - - we're focused on _content_- how do we fill out these structures
- - - what is this structure
- - Maniac Mansion (https://classicreload.com/maniac-mansion.html)
- - - design-a-mansion:
- - - - what can we do to make a _bad_ game
- - - - what can we do to make a _good_ game
- - - solved a lot of mechanical gripes, but again- not super interested in that
- - - makes more visible architecture
- - - look how it fills it out- puzzles, etc...
- - Broken Age (steam)
- - - design-a-broken-age:
- - - - let's talk about what makes this _good_
- - - - - interactions tell the story
- - - - - posing a question as communication
- - - - - leans into mystery
- - - - - there's "what happens next" as well as "what's happening"
- - - - look at the density here
- - - - the nature of the interactions
- - Carmen San Diego (https://classicreload.com/where-in-the-world-is-carmen-sandiego-deluxe-edition.html)
- - - mechanically driven
- - - - uses reality as a test
- - - - NOT AVENUE worth persuing
- - - tight bounds per-room
- - - really solves density issue
