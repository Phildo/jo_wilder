- Purpose
- - We have to design a game
- - will more-or-less conform to a formula
- - let's learn a bit about the formula to orient ourselves
- - we'll use the history of the genre to figure out why/how it's at where it's at

- - - design-a-broken-age:
- - - - let's talk about what makes this _good_
- - - - - interactions tell the story
- - - - - posing a question as communication
